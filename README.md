# Job Sieve

Searching for jobs is an exhausting and daunting task. Aside from applying to the jobs themselves and interviewing for them if you are lucky, most of your time will be spent sifting through hundreds or even thousands of job postings, entering increasingly precise search keywords, CTRL-F for a keyword in the job title, right click to build a farm of potential listings, and manually harvesting those tabs for viable prospects worth of an application. The trouble with this is that it's time consuming to perform this search process when you could be concentrating your efforts on improving the quality and specificity of your applications and nailing the interview. This project performs the job filtering process out of your hands and gives you a list of viable job prospects based on the parameters given to it.
