    "This analysis component seeks to answer the question: What is industry looking for in its candidates? In this sense, what we are really looking for are common keywords used amongst them. These keywords represent the terms under which an employer is more likely to consider a given candidate. Examples included \"degree\", \"bachelors\", \"masters\", \"experience\", \"X certification\", etc. There are many ways to execute this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predefined list of terms can be compiled and compared against the applications. The advantage of this approach lies in its simplicity. Without having to mine for key words, a boolean state is determined representing if the posting either has or does not have the given keyword. Unfortunately, this approach also limits the scope of the analysis to those keywords that are known by the users and cannot be used to mine for novel keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, more convoluted approach, involves comparing all job postings against each other to determine what words they have in common. The issue with this approach is that many meaningless keywords will be identified. At first, structural words like \"the\" will be identified in mass. After being filtered out, the next issue will be in filtering out contextually-dependent and insigificant words like \"application\" and \"responsibilities\". This filtering process will take up more time than any other component of this project. For this reason, the predefined approach will be used.\n",

    "My particular interest lies in determining what computerscience/cybersecurity certifications are most in demand by employers. Consequently, the predetermined keyword approach is best suited. Compilations of certifications like [this one](https://www.webopedia.com/reference/computer-certifications/) will serve nicely for seeding the target keywords list.\n",
